# Stock_Analysis
VBA Analysis


# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to develop code to loop through all the data collected. For that, we should refactor the code to make the VBA script more efficient.

# Results
The stock performance for 2017 is much better in comparison to 2018. As we have flagged by the Red color.
Stock Comparison

The results for Green Stock file was accurate matching for the original macro in the “AllStockAnalysis” module activity and the refactored code (VBA_Challenge.xlsm).

The execution time in the refactored code is more efficient in comparison to the original macro (Module activity).

Point 2 and 3 are exemplified by the images below. VBA_GreenStock_2017_Module2 VBA_Challenge_2017_Refactored VBA_GreenStock_2018_Module2 VBA_Challenge_2018_Refactored

Code was optimized by elimination of a nested for loop. This reduced computation time.

# Summary
What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
The advantages of refactoring code may include improved the execution time, make the code easier to understand and easier to debug.

The disadvantages of refactoring code may include more time and money to develop. In case you don't have time to refactor the code, it is not recommended to try.

How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
For this example, the refactored code optimized the execution time. Also, make the code easier to understand by avoiding nested loops.
